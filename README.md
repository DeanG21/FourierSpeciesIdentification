# Project Title: Fourier Analysis for Species Identification

## Project Overview:
This project aims to utilize Fourier analysis as a key method for identifying different wood species (Ash, Oak, and Beech) based on the frequencies produced when the wood blocks are struck. By applying non-destructive testing (NDT) techniques, the project investigates the relationship between the volume of wood blocks and their peak frequencies.

The project was conducted as part of a group effort, with different team members contributing to various sections. However, all of the coding for the Fourier analysis, filtering, and plotting was done by myself.

## Team Contributions:
Alex: Introduction
Jack: Data gathering and initial analysis
Dean: Results presentation
John: Data recording and equipment setup
Caitlin: Methodology description
Jane: Discussion and interpretation of results
Morgan: Conclusion

## My Role:
I was responsible for all of the coding aspects of the project, including:

Developing the Python scripts to perform the Fourier Transform.
Applying high-pass filtering to remove background noise from the audio data.
Writing functions to compute the Fourier transform on the sound recordings.
Plotting the results to visualize the relationship between the wood block size and their frequencies.
Analyzing the frequency data to identify differences between species.
Project Goals:
Distinguish between Ash, Oak, and Beech blocks by analyzing the frequencies produced when struck.
Determine the relationship between the block volume and its peak frequency.
Predict frequencies for any given volume of block using graphical analysis.
